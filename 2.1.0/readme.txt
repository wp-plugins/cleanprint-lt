CleanPrint 4.0 – Efficient content output to print, PDF, email, Dropbox (coming soon)

== Description ==
CleanPrint has processed hundreds of millions of print jobs on top web sites. We’ve taken everything we’ve learned and built it into this economically and ecologically friendly print tool that saves paper, ink, and money for your users. 

How CleanPrint Works

CleanPrint is activated in a lightbox when the print button is clicked next to your content. Before printing or saving your content, users can eliminate images, increase or decrease font size, and eliminate or grayscale text. The CleanPrint window includes sharing tools and a paper saving counter that shows visitors how eco-friendly your site is.

Using Your Own Buttons

If you prefer to use your own print link or button instead of one of the provided buttons you may do so by:

1. Disable the buttons via the 'exclude' button option in the CleanPrint Settings page.
2. Insert a hyperlink into your page as per the example below:
   * &lt;a href='.' onClick='CleanPrint(); return false' title='Print page'&gt;Print&lt;/a&gt;
   * &lt;a href='.' onClick='CleanEmail(); return false' title='Email page'&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt;
   * &lt;a href='.' onClick='CleanPDF(); return false' title='PDF page'&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt;
