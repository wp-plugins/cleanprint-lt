Important - Read Carefully:  This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a
legal agreement between you and Format Dynamics, Inc. ("Format Dynamics") for
certain content you have selected to download from the Format Dynamics website
(the "Content").  BY INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE
CONTENT, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY
ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
EULA, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,
PLEASE PRESS THE "REJECT" BUTTON AND DO NOT INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS OR OTHERWISE

License Grant. The Content is protected by copyright laws, international
copyright treaties and other intellectual property laws and treaties.  The
Content is licensed on a non-exclusive basis, not sold.  All rights not
expressly granted are reserved by Format Dynamics. Not limiting the foregoing,
this EULA does not grant you any rights to (and you are prohibited from):
(i) granting any sublicense, distributing or transmitting the Content in whole
or in part; (ii) modifying the Content; (iii) reverse engineering, decompiling,
or disassembling the Content, except as expressly permitted by applicable law;
(iv) using any trademarks of Format Dynamics; or (v) using the Content for
purposes other than as expressly authorized by Format Dynamics.  Your rights
under this EULA may not be transferred, leased, assigned, or sublicensed.  Any
purported attempt to transfer, lease, assign, or sublicense your rights will be
void.

Confidentiality.  The Content contains information and valuable trade secrets
that are not generally known to the public. You must treat as confidential and
preserve the confidentiality of the Content, and must not disclose any portion
of the Content to any third party.  The foregoing obligation does not apply to
any information that: (a) is already in your possession as shown by
documentation; (b) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of your
own; or (c) is obtained by you from a third person without breach by such third
person of an obligation of confidence.  Information will not be deemed to be
within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is: (i) embraced by more
general information in the public domain or in the possession of the party
receiving such information, or (ii) a combination of individual items of
information that could be pieced together to reconstruct such combination from
non-Confidential Information.

Ownership of Intellectual Property.  As between you and Format Dynamics, all
rights in and to the Content are owned by Format Dynamics, including all rights
provided under copyright law, trademark law, patent law, trade secret law, and
all other forms of proprietary and intellectual property protection.

Breach; Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, Format Dynamics may
terminate this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms of this EULA.  In such
an event, you must destroy all copies of the Content.  You may terminate this
EULA at any time by discontinuing use of the Content, erasing the Content from
all computer memories and storage devices within your possession or control,
and destroying all materials obtained from Format Dynamics and all related
documentation and all copies and installations thereof, whether made under
these terms or otherwise. In the event of termination by you or Format Dynamics,
you will not receive a refund of any license fees paid by you for use of the
Content, if any.

Disclaimer of  Warranties; Exclusion of Damages; Limitation of Liability. 	

If you are dissatisfied with the Content, or with any terms of this EULA, your
sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Content.  Format Dynamics
assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable for the accuracy,
completeness, timeliness, reliability, relevance or usefulness of the Content
or for any problems that may result from your use of the Content.  Format
Dynamics also assumes no responsibility and is not liable for any damages to,
or viruses that may infect, your computer equipment or other property on
account of your access to, use of the Content.

THE CONTENT IS PROVIDED AS IS.  FORMAT DYNAMICS MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR
REPRESENTATIONS AS TO THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN, AND PROVIDES
NO GUARANTEE AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF DELETION, MISDELIVERY OR FAILURE TO
STORE COMMUNICATIONS, PERSONALIZED SETTINGS, OR OTHER DATA.  IN NO EVENT WILL
FORMAT DYNAMICS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING IN
CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE CONTENT.  FORMAT DYNAMICS HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR LACK OF VIRUSES.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL FORMAT DYNAMICS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES
WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR ANY INJURY TO PERSON OR
PROPERTY, LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF  BUSINESS
INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
USE THE CONTENT, EVEN IF FORMAT DYNAMICS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT WILL FORMAT DYNAMICS' LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT
YOU PAID FOR THIS CONTENT, IF ANYTHING.  Some states or jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or special
damages, or the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an
implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

Indemnification.  You agree to indemnify and to hold Format Dynamics harmless
from any and all claims (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs)
resulting from your acts, omissions, or representations in any way related to
this EULA or your access to, and use of, the Content. You will use your best
efforts to cooperate with us in the defense of any claim. Format Dynamics
reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and
control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.

General.   This EULA and the rights and obligations of the parties with respect
to the Content will be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Colorado, USA, without reference to the choice of law
principles thereof.  Any actions, proceedings or suits concerning or relating
to this EULA may only be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Denver,
Colorado, and each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such
court, and waives any objections thereto.  This EULA will not be governed by the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  If
any part of this EULA is found unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this EULA and the parties will
substitute for the invalid provision a provision which most closely approximates
the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision.  Failure by either
party to complain of any act or failure to act of the other party or to declare
the other party in default, irrespective of the duration of such default, will
not constitute a waiver of rights hereunder. The Content may not be shipped into
any country or used in any manner prohibited by law, regulation or order.
Except as provided below, no amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision
of this EULA will be effective unless it is set forth in a writing signed by an
authorized officer of both parties.  This EULA constitutes the complete
agreement between you and Format Dynamics with respect to the Content and
supersedes all proposals (oral or written), all previous negotiations, and all
other communications, except as set forth above.  Format Dynamics may at any
time, in its sole discretion, revise the terms of this EULA by updating them on
the Format Dynamics website.  You are bound by any such revisions and should
therefore periodically visit the Format Dynamics website to review the current
EULA.
