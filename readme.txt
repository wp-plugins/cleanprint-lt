The CleanPrint plugin for WordPress provides paginated, magazine-like output when readers print your posts, allowing logos, comics and print ads.  

== Description ==
The CleanPrint plugin for WordPress dynamically creates print-optimized content when users print your blog posts. It creates paginated output that allows you to:
*   Provide the reader with only the content that is relevant on the printed page, improving the user's experience and saving paper and ink
*   Place a custom logo on the top of each page
*   Place a custom print button within each page
*   Flow content into multiple columns, increasing readability
*   Optionally include print advertisements in your printed posts, earning you money when people print your content

The printed content of your site will resemble a magazine page, lending a professional look to your printed blog posts. 

The single post view adds a print button to the bottom of each post, showing users that these pages are optimized for print.

Please note that not all themes will produce perfect printouts with this plugin.
