== Description ==
The CleanPrint plugin for WordPress dynamically optimizes content for output to print, PDF and email. With CleanPrint your readers can:
*   Remove images
*   Remove text
*   Change font size
*   Add notes to printout
*   Save paper, ink, money and the environment

By installing CleanPrint for WordPress you provide the reader with output control, improving their experience on your site.

The single post view adds a print button to each post, showing users that these pages are optimized for print, PDF and email.

Please note that not all themes will produce perfect printouts with this plugin. You can test your content at http://cpf.cleanprint.net/cpf/instructions.html.
